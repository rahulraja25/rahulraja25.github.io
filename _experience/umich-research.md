- Modeled adaptive PID feedback loops in Simulink, lowering steady-state error by 12%.
- Designed noise-shielded layouts in Cadence Virtuoso, reducing PSRR-induced noise by 20%.
- Built custom memory pipelines in Chisel for RISC-V SoCs, cutting data latency by 14%.
- Performed Monte Carlo simulations to optimize control model stability thresholds.
- Used JMP and FMEA to identify board-level failure modes, cutting propagation issues by 22%.
- Authored hardware validation reports in LaTeX to support internal review and publication.
