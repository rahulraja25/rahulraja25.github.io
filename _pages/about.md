I’m Rahul Raja, an Embedded Systems Engineer with a Master’s degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Michigan. At Karh, I engineered battery management system (BMS) firmware with a focus on thermal fault detection, real-time control loop tuning, and system validation in distributed embedded environments. My technical foundation spans embedded C, Simulink, Python, and system-level modeling with a focus on building reliable, safety-critical systems that scale.

My work blends embedded development, hardware-aware system design, and data-driven debugging across energy, automation, and safety tech. Whether it’s firmware for a prototype BMS or an SoC accelerator for a custom core, I focus on clarity, correctness, and pushing embedded systems to their best performance.
Every system has its limits. I build the tools that push them further.

I’ve worked across hardware-software boundaries from analog-level design to bootloader timing and field validation with a sharp eye for failure modes and fault handling. Tools like JMP, FMEA, and Monte Carlo simulation aren’t just checkboxes they help me build systems that hold up under pressure. I enjoy collaborating in high-ownership environments where every design decision gets tested in the real world. Across teams, I’ve been known to bring calm to chaos organizing debug workflows, leading integration tests, and getting things unstuck. I'm deeply motivated by solving problems that matter, especially when they sit at the edge of innovation and reliability.

Off the clock, I lose myself in football the only system I trust to run in real time without crashing. Messi? He’s not just my favorite player; he’s proof that genius can look effortless.
